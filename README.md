# bash-scripts

This is a collection of simple bash scripts that I use to help in bug bounty hunting. Scripts here are either works-in-progress towards an MVP or are just too simple to warrant an application of their own.

As always, feedback is appreciated and I am particularly interested if you think there are use-cases where these scripts can be extended.
